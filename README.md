# Naughts-and-Crosses

A naughts and crosses game written in the Python language

This is my first Python project.

The user can play a game of naughts and crosses with a computerised opponent.

To play the game run main.py.

The board consists of a 3x3 array. So when selecting your move you will have to type the index of of the array on which you want to insert your 'X' or '0'. For instance if you wanted to 
place your choice in the the first slot in the grid (the top left) you would input "0,0". The next slot in the grid would be "0,1" (top middle). If you wanted to select the middle space 
in the grid your selection would be "1,1". The last square on the grid (bottom right) is "2,2". The first digit represents the row and the second digit represents the column. Both of 
these digits must be separated by a comma.
